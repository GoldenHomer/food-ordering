food-ordering
=============

Internal team project done at Coding House. Allows users to vote on an array of restaurants and then select from the winning restaurant's menu. The original application is deployed at http://tranquil-plains-1058.herokuapp.com. 

Here's the recent version: http://evening-inlet-7077.herokuapp.com/

I've found Heroku isn't the most reliable at times so try the URL again if you get an error message.
